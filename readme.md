## What exactly is [_Adventure Time_](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_with_Finn_and_Jake_Wiki)? 🤔
- _Adventure Time_ is a story about the last human boy, Finn, and his best friend (and adoptive brother) Jake, a magical dog with powers to change shape and size at will. The duo fights against monsters and villians to keep the candy-citizens of Candy Kingdom safe. Sometimes they're assisted with the help of Princess Bubblegum, leader of Candy Kingdom.
